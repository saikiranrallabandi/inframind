EVALUATION RESULTS:
==================
Overall Accuracy: 97.3% (107/110)

BY CATEGORY:
------------
| Category        | Accuracy | Correct/Total |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| Ansible         | 100.0%   | 15/15         |
| CloudFormation  | 100.0%   | 10/10         |
| Docker-compose  | 100.0%   | 15/15         |
| Dockerfile      |  93.3%   | 14/15         |
| GitHub-Actions  | 100.0%   | 15/15         |
| Kubernetes      |  90.0%   | 18/20         |
| Terraform       | 100.0%   | 20/20         |

COMPARISON WITH BASELINES:
--------------------------
| Model                    | Accuracy | Improvement |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Base Qwen2.5-0.5B        | 45.0%    | -           |
| SFT Fine-tuned           | 64.5%    | +19.5pp     |
| GRPO Fine-tuned          | 97.3%    | +52.3pp     |

NOTES:
------
- GRPO shows significant improvement over SFT baseline (+32.8pp)
- Perfect scores on Ansible, CloudFormation, Docker-compose, GitHub-Actions, Terraform
- Dockerfile and Kubernetes categories show room for improvement
- Rule-based evaluation using decomposed reward function (syntax + semantic + structure)

EVALUATION METHODOLOGY:
----------------------
- Reward function: R = 0.4 * syntax_score + 0.3 * semantic_score + 0.3 * structure_score
- Pass threshold: reward >= 0.6
- Evaluation performed on held-out test set (not seen during training)
